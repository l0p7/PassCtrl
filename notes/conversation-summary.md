# Conversation Summary

## Request Highlights
- Refactored `internal/server/router_test.go` to drive handlers through httpexpect table cases using a mockery-generated `PipelineHTTP` mock and rewired runtime rule execution suites to use mockery-generated HTTP clients; confirmed `go test ./...` and `golangci-lint run ./...` remain green.
- Captured the new testing conventions (table-driven testify patterns, httpexpect helpers, mockery workflow, and required validation commands) in AGENTS.md and `design/technical-requirements.md`.
- Documented the cached lint invocation, mockery regeneration flow, and mock directory layout across README and `docs/index.md`.
- Added a mockery-generated `pipeline.Agent` seam to instrumentation tests and introduced injectable factories in `cmd/main.go` so new unit tests can assert loader/server failure handling without launching the binary.
- Promoted the metrics recorder to an interface, generated a mock, and exercised pipeline/result caching metrics expectations directly in tests.
- Extended rules loader coverage for invalid variable expressions and broadened the integration harness to cover explicit endpoint selection, deny-path failures, and health/explain JSON responses.
- Added unit coverage for pipeline shutdown/fallback, cache invalidation, rulechain defaults, CEL `Program.Source`, and renderer metadata helpers.
- Hardened the CLI integration harness and admission tests for lint compliance; ensured `buildDecisionCache` is tested for memory/Redis paths.
- Documented golangci-lint usage (local cache example) in `AGENTS.md`; updated notes to reflect coverage improvements.
- Resolved golangci-lint findings (errcheck, noctx, gosec, gci, errorlint) and verified the suite cleanly (`golangci-lint run`).

## Key Commands
- `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache GOMODCACHE=$(pwd)/.gomodcache go test ./...`
- `mkdir -p .gocache .gomodcache .golangci-lint && GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.gocache GOMODCACHE=$(pwd)/.gomodcache GOLANGCI_LINT_CACHE=$(pwd)/.golangci-lint golangci-lint run ./...`

## Documentation
- AGENTS.md now includes instructions for running golangci-lint with repo-local caches.
- Added notes in `notes/progress.md` summarizing the new coverage and lint workflow.
